* Questions 
1. How is the time actual partitioned? if we're talking about an order of magnitude different at each SDC level, we start to get into too-fine or too-coarse time scales, i.e. is there really a benefit to having sub-attosecond resolution? 
   i guess people can't really simulate that sort of thing right now. 
2. This leads to question 2, what processes can we look (attosecond laser experiments) 
   to really justify this kind of time-resolution? SDC sweeps at nano, femto, attosecond scales? This also means that multi-rate problems should be in the scope, ie nuclear/electron coupled time-regimes. This will be hard, though. tunneling.
3. These problems can be light/phonon based experiments where short-time response is limited.
   + predictor-corrector schemes in parareal time-parallel algorithms is 
     kind of like these generative-adversarial network (GAN) schemes [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434v2.pdf][unsupervised
     representational learning with DCGANs]]. is there a connection here that can
     be exploited? this is quite different than the traditional model constructed
     from input data as there is a correction step.
   + Full-CI (or anything formed as a matrix problem) presents a way to have 
     effectively an N-D problem that is analogous to an N-D image. This image has
     particular features that can be extracted/deconvoluted (via neural nets). The
     thought that doesn't make sense to me is how you could take 'random noise' and
     have it create a 'real(-ish)' image from it. In this analogy, what is the real 
     image and how is it created? 
         \gamma(x_1, x_2, t) = \sum_\mu\nu |\phi(x_1, t)><\phi(x_2, t)| is a 2-d, time-dependent object,
     where would its data come from?
   + as opposed to Coulomb matrix metric (see: Rupp et al), maybe a z-matrix
     approach could be more effective/just as cheap to compute
4. Casting problem in Liouville space means that we now have a semi-linear problem
   that can be (in principle) solved by any of the regular ODE/PDE solvers.
   However, we still need to answer the question as to why the Magnus expansion is
   almost always chosen for this particular problem. Michael is claiming based on
   his math bible that the Magnus expansion preserves some property of the Lie
   group that our solutions live on and thus preserve most importantly the
   idempotency of the density matrix (which is an unsubstantiated claim made by
   Lopata, Govind).
5. I'm going to try to print out P^{2}-P and this shit better be close to zero in their code
   otherwise there's really no reason for us to really pursue Magnus integration.
   OR that leaves us with a way to try to fix their problem or at least understand
   it better.

* Notes
+ Can we instead write a propagation scheme for Omega, rather than the density, 
  where we can use regular SDC machinery?
+ Tau correction for magnus-picard: each new iteration is just the previous iteration
  plus the residual (and for multi-level, the restricted residual)
+ Benefits to Picard:
  + all fevals can be done simultaneously
+ Benefits to SDC:
  + convergence criteria is stronger
+ Understand the eigenvalue spectrum of propagator for P vs. Omega
+ see nb1p10 for details on structure of code at first glance
+ Maybe it's in our benefit to compute the BCH expansion of $UPU^{\dagger}$
  + it gives us the ability to do various truncations
  + can only be performed if $e^{W}Pe^{W}$ is hermitian, not necessarily true if $e^{W}$ is not hermitian

** Intro
   One of the main focus of high performance computing in the quantum chemistry
   field is the direct parallelization of the spatial component of the wavefunction
   (or density in the case of density functional theory). This is an adequate
   solution for static, non-dynamical processes and modeling, but becomes
   problematic when real-time properties are of the target. The most
   straight-forward way to sample time-configuration space is to allocate single
   trajectories (which may use $M$ multiple processors to parallelize the spatial
   problem) to a single node, resulting in $N$ nodes for the $N$ different
   trajectories. 

   In this formulation, each of the $N$ nodes computes the solution to the
   time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation for each of the prescribed time steps,
   with each time-step costing as much as the chosen electronic structure method,
   resulting in a total computational cost of $N*M*t*m$, where $N$ is the total
   number of trajectories, $M$ is the total number of processors for each
   electronic structure calculation, $t$ is the total number of time steps, and
   $m$ is the cost of the electronic structure calculation (for DFT this is
   generally cubic with respect to system size). In order to have statistically
   meaningful information, a large number of trajectories (large $N$) are
   generally needed.

   Calculations of this magnitude are generally limited to molecular systems of
   small size and for relatively short time lengths. Calculations can be
   significantly sped up by the use of cheaper methods such as force-field based
   methods, or by more obviously decreasing the length of time to be simluated.

   An alternate formulation for longer-time simulations of electronic processes
   is to use so-called parallel-in-time methods. These methods have been
   traditionally applied to problems in fluid dynamics, where a uniform
   time-mesh is used. The premise of parallel-in-time methods relies on the use
   of a combination of methods, with one or more being significantly less
   computationally expensive than the other. Properties are computed using the
   cheap, less-accurate method and than iteratively corrected by the more
   accurate (and more expensive) method. This type of methodology is well-suited
   for multirate or time multiscale processes. However, if enough orders of
   magnitude are scanned in time, the types of motion that needs to be
   considered differs dramatically

** Background
*** Time-dependent quantum mechanics
   The dynamics of an arbitrary molecular system is governed by the
   time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation $i\partial_{t}|\Psi(t)> = H|\Psi(t)>,$ where
   $|\Psi(t)>=\Phi_{n}\Phi_{s}$ is the total molecular wavefunction consisting of a nuclear
   wavefunction $\Phi_{n}$ and electronic wavefunction $\Phi_{s}$. In the Born-Oppenheimer
   approximation, the time scales of the nuclear and electronic wavefunctions can
   be treated on completely different time scales giving rise to separate
   equations of motion for each wavefunction. Though much interesting physics is
   governed on the interaction of the two different time scales, here we are
   concerned only with the time-evolution of the electronic wavefunction.

   The electronic time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation closely resembles the
   total molecular TDSE $i\partial_{t}|\Phi_{s}> = H|\Phi_{s}>$. Here, the electronic
   wavefunction $\Phi_{s}$ lives in an N-dimensional Hilbert space. An alternative
   formulation that significantly reduces the computational complexity of dealing
   with an $N$-D Hilbert space requires the use of the one-body reduced density
   matrix $\gamma=|\Phi_{s}><\Phi_{s}$. The TDSE is then rewritten in terms of $\gamma$ in the
   form of the von Neumann equation of motion $\partial_{t}\gamma(t)=-i[H,\gamma],$ where
   the square brackets indicate the matrix commutator. The goal of the present
   work is to determine $\gamma(t)$ for a time-dependent Hamiltonian that represents a
   molecular system interacting with a time-dependent field.

   Pragmatically speaking, the difference between linear response TDDFT
   (LR-TDDFT) and real-time TDDFT (RT-TDDFT) is the choice of frequency space
   versus time space. Both pictures aim to solve the same set of
   single-particle equations, the time-dependent Kohn-Sham (TDKS) equations
   $i\partial_{t}\psi_{i}(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^{2} + v_{KS}[\rho](\mathbf{r},t)\right]\psi_{i}(\mathbf{r},t),
   where $v_{KS}[\rho]$ is the time-dependent Kohn-Sham potential that maps the
   density of the non-interacting system to the density of the interacting one.
   The density $\rho(\mathbf{r},t) = \sum_{i}^{N_{occ}}|\psi_{i}(\mathbf{r},t)|^}2|$ is the
   sum over occupied orbitals and represents the real-space probability
   distribution for finding an electron at $\mathbf{r}$ at time $t$.
   RT-TDDFT is based on the explicit time-propagation of the time-dependent density. 

   Wavefunction expanded in a Gaussian basis sets $\psi_{i}(\mathbf{r},t)=\sum_{i}^{N_{AO}} C_{\mu i}(t)\phi_{\mu}(x)$ 
   The one-electron reduced density matrix $\gamma(x_{1},x_{2},t)=\sum_{i}^{N}\psi_i(x_{1},t)\psi^{*}_{i}(x_2,t)$

   Direct integration of the von Neumann equation of motion for the one-electron
   reduced density matrix $\gamma$ yields $\gamma(t) = U(t,t0)\gamma(t_0)U^{\dagger}(t,t0)$ where
   $U(t,t_0) = T exp^{-i\int_{t0}^{t} H(\tau)d\tau}$. An expression for $U$ can
   obtained using the Magnus expansion of the time-evolution operator where
   $U(t,t_0)$ is written as matrix exponential, where the matrix is expressed in a
   power-series-like expressions. Truncation at order $n$ constitutes an $n$th
   order Magnus expansion. 
  
   The main challenge associated with the use of a Magnus expansion is the
   requisite of knowing the Fock matrix for the subsequent time step. An
   approximate F needs to be constructed. 

   Casting the Magnus expansion as a deferred correction: In order to make
   significant gains in the propagation of the reduced density matrix $\gamma$, it is
   possible to avoid the expensive Fock build at each time step by replacing the
   Fock build with a cheaper alternative followed by a periodic correction
   scheme. Spectral deferred corrections (SDC) have been used to successfully
   parallelize the time-dimension calculation of many problems in fluid dynamics
   and [] and operate on the premise of performing a sweep where a cheap (coarse)
   calculation is run and then corrected by an expensive (fine) calculation.
   These methods have been primarily used where meshes for the time and space
   dimensions are applied. 

   The true power of an SDC-type method comes from the exploitation of the ratio
   in the cost of the fine versus coarse propagator. Presently, the way that the
   matrix exponential is computed in NWChem relies on either diagonalization or a
   truncated power-series expression. On the diagonalization front (a typically
   $O(N^3)$ FLOPs operation), significant speed ups can be obtained by considering
   a coarser system.
